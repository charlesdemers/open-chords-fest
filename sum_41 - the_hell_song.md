# Sum 41 - The Hell Song

```
Am                       F     C                   G
 Everybody's got their problems  Everybody says the same things to you
Am                            F
 It's just a matter of how you solve them
C                              G
 And knowing how to change the things you've been through
Am             F             C             G      
 I feel I've come to realize how fast life can be compromised
Am              F                C         G                        Am F C G
 Step back to see what's going on I can't believe this happened to you
                    Am F C G
this happened to you
Am                                F
 It's just a problem that we're faced with am I 
C                      G
 not the only one who hates to stand by
Am                     F
 Complications ended first in this line 
C                                G
 with all this pictures running through my mind
Am               F           C         G
 knowing endless consequences I feel so useless in this 
Am               F              C           G
 Get back step back and as for me I can't believe

        Am,            F                C              G
Part of me won't agree cause I don't know if it's for sure
       Am        F         C           G
Suddenly suddenly I don't feel so insecure


        Am,            F                C              G
Part of me won't agree cause I don't know if it's for sure
       Am        F         C           G
Suddenly suddenly I don't feel so insecure
