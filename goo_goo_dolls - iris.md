Verse 1:
         G        Asus      Cadd9  
And I'd give up forever to touch you
         G            Asus       Cadd9
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
           G        Asus         Cadd9
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
      Em            D             Cadd9 
And I don't want to go home right now


Verse 2:
    G         Asus          Cadd9  
And all I can taste is this moment
    G         Asus          Cadd9  
And all I can breathe is your life
      G        Asus       Cadd9  
Cause sooner or later it's over
       Em            D             Cadd9 
I just don't want to miss you tonight


Chorus
      G            Asus        Cadd9  
And I don't want the world to see me
        Em                D             Cadd9 
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     G            Asus        Cadd9  
When everything's made to be broken
       Em          D          Cadd9 
I just want you to know who I am


Verse 3:
        G               Asus             Cadd9  
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
       G          Asus         Cadd9  
Or the moment of truth in your lies
     G          Asus           Cadd9  
When everything feels like the movies
         Em            D          Cadd9 
Yeah you bleed just to know your alive


Chorus
      G            Asus        Cadd9  
And I don't want the world to see me
        Em                D             Cadd9 
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     G            Asus        Cadd9  
When everything's made to be broken
       Em          D          Cadd9 
I just want you to know who I am


Here just play:  G Asus Cadd9


Chorus
      G            Asus        Cadd9  
And I don't want the world to see me
        Em                D             Cadd9 
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     G            Asus        Cadd9  
When everything's made to be broken
       Em          D          Cadd9 
I just want you to know who I am

       Em          D          Cadd9 
I just want you to know who I am
       Em          D          Cadd9 
I just want you to know who I am
       Em          D          Cadd9
