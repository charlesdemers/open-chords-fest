# Chicago - 25 or 6 to 4

```
Am                          F  E
Waiting for the break of day
Am                          F  E
Searching for something to say
Am                          F  E
Flashing lights against the sky
Am                          F  E
Giving up I close my eyes
F                             C
Sitting cross-legged on the floor
G         F
25 or 6 to 4

Staring blindly into space
Getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake
Wondering how much I can take
Should I try to do some more
25 or 6 to 4

Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day
25 or 6 to 4
25 or 6 to 4
