# Bon Jovi - Bed of Roses

```
[Intro:] Bb F Bb F (2x)

[Verso 1:]
 Bb
Sitting here wasted and wounded
           F
This old piano
        Bb
Trying hard to capture the moment
                F
This morning I don't know
          Am                      -Bb
'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head
           F
And some blond gave me nightmares
                         Bb
Think she's still in my bed
       Bb                    -C                         F
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

[Verso 2:]
        Bb
With an ironclad fist
                                F
I wake up, and French kiss the morning
            Bb
While some marching band keepsits own beat
                      F
In my head while we're talking
      Am                        -Bb
About all of the things, that I long to believe
       F
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
          Bb
And the truth is
 Bb         -C          -F  -F  C-C*
Baby, you're all that I need

[Refrão 1:]
         Dm-Dm
I wanna lay
    -C        -Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm -Dm
For tonite
   -C        -Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
               Bb
Oh, I want to be
         -F
Just as close as
     Bb   -F
The Holy Ghost is
     Dm -C  -Bb -Bb
And lay you down
Bb     -Bb*    F
  On a bed of roses

[Verso 3:]
          Bb
Well I'm so far away
                           F
Step that I take is on my way home
        Bb
King's ransom in dimes
                                      F
Given each night to see through this payphone
         Am
Still I run out of time
        -Bb
Or it's hard to get through
          F
Till the bird on the wire
Flies me back to you
      Bb
I'll just close my eyes, whisper
 Bb    -C            -F -F C-C*
Baby, blind love is true

[Refrão 2:]
         Dm-Dm
I wanna lay
    -C        -Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm -Dm
For tonite
   -C        -Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
               Bb
Oh, I want to be
         -F
Just as close as
     Bb   -F
The Holy Ghost is
     Dm -C  -Bb -Bb
And lay you down
Bb     -Bb*    F    -C
  On a bed of roses

[Ponte:]
           Bb
Well this hotel bar hangover
 -C                        F
Whiskey's gone dry the barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
   Bb
I might have said yeah
       Bb            -C          F -F C  -C*
But I laughed so hard I think I died, uh yeah!...

[Solo:] Dm-C-Bb-F (3x) Dm-C-Bb-Bb Bb-Bb* F

[Verso 4:]
        Bb
Now as you close your eyes
                        F
Know I'll be thinking about you
          Bb
While my mistress she calls me
                         F
To stand in her spotlight again
           Bb
Tonite, I won't be alone
                                      F
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
          Dm         -C            -Bb
I've got nothing to prove for it's you
         -Bb       F  -C
That I'd die to defend

[Refrão 3:]
         Dm-Dm
I wanna lay
    -C        -Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm -Dm
For tonite
   -C        -Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
               Bb
Oh, I want to be
         -F
Just as close as
     Bb   -F
The Holy Ghost is
     Dm -C  -Bb -Bb Bb
And lay you down
         Dm-Dm
I wanna lay
    -C        -Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm -Dm
For tonite
   -C        -Bb  F
I sleep on a be...ed of nails!
           Bb
I want to be
         -F
Just as close as
     Bb   -F
The Holy Ghost is!
 Dm -C  -Bb (-Bb)
Lay you down
(Bb)   (-Bb*)   F
    The bed of roses
