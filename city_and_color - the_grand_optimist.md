# City and Color - The Grand Optimist

```
Capo 2

For the C and the Am, he throws his pinky onto the fourth fret of the G string.
Cmaj7  - x32410
AmAdd9 - x02410

And he specifically does the C to Am walk down, so he uses the G/B
G/B      - X20030

Intro: C G/B Am C G/B Am

Verse:

C          G/B            Am
I fear I'm dying of complications

      C              G/B                    Am
Complications due to things that I've left undone

            C                  G/B
That all my debts will be left unpaid

            Am
Feel like a cripple without a cane

           C               G/B
I'm like a jack of all trades

                  Am
Who's a master of none

Intro twice, on the second time he throws in
a little riff. Dallas plays it that way.

Verse 2:

C               G/B
Then there's my father

Am
He's always looking on the bright side

       C            G/B                       Am
Saying things like "son life just ain't that hard"

          C            G/B
He is the grand optimist

         Am
I am the world's poor pessimist

             C                G/B
You give him buttons sometimes

                   Am
And he will escape unscarred


Pre-Chorus/Chorus:

G                       Am
I guess I take after my mother    x2


I used to be quite resilient
Gain no strength from counting the beads on a rosary
Now the wound has begun to turn
Another lesson that has gone unlearned
But this is not a cry for pitty or for sympathy

I guess I take after my mother
