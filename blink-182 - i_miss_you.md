Capo on the 4th fret.

Chords (speaking relatively)

Em7      - 022033

Em7*     - 020003 (I'm not sure how to call this chord)

Dsus4/F# - 2x0233 (Alternatively, while playing the chorus, you can
transform Dsus4/F# into 2x0232. It sounds better, but it's harder to play)

Verse 1

  G              Dsus4
Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
    Em7                             Dsus4/F#
The shadow in the background of the morgue
                 G         Dsus4
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
       Em7                            Dsus4/F#
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
                     G
Where you can always find me
           Dsus4
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
    Em7                                Dsus4/F#
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
                      G [this is also the starting chorus chord]
We'll wish this never ends


Chorus

G       A7sus4      Em7*    Dsus4     


Cadd9   Dsus4/F#    Cadd9
                            (I miss you,miss you)




Verse 2

      G           Dsus4
Where are you and I'm so sorry
  Em7                           Dsus4/F#
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
                    G
I need somebody and always
     Dsus4
This sick strange darkness
      Em7                           Dsus4/F#
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
                  G
And as I stared I counted
Dsus4
Webs from all the spiders
Em7                                Dsus4/F#
Catching things and eating their insides
                   G
Like indecision to call you
    Dsus4
and hear your voice of treason
     Em7                                Dsus4/F#
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
                 G [to chorus]
Stop this pain tonight


Chorus
     
G                A7sus4    Em7*        Dsus4                  
Don't waste your time on   me you're already
    Cadd9   Dsus4/F#   Cadd9                   
The voice inside my    head            (I miss you, miss you)
G                A7sus4    Em7*        Dsus4                         
Don' waste your  time on   me you're already
    Cadd9   Dsus4/F#   Cadd9                       
The voice inside my    head            (I miss you, miss you)
