```
F             G           F          G
You should ve seen by the look in my eyes, baby
F         G         F      G
There was something missing
F             G            F          G
You should ve known by the tone of my voice, maybe
F       G      F      G
But you didn't listen
F          G
You played dead
F             G
But you never bled
  Am
Instead you lay still in the grass
                  G
All coiled up and hissing

F            G         F          G
And though I know all about those men
F       G       F     G
Still I don't remember
F            G        F          G
Cause it was us baby, way before then
F         G       F     G
And we're still together
F     G      F            G
And I meant, every word I said
       Am
When I said that I love you I meant
                   G
That I love you forever

              C       F     G
And I'm gonna keep on lovin you
               C    F             G
Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
Am           
I don't wanna sleep
             G
I just wanna keep on lovin you

F     G      F            G
And I meant, every word I said
       Am
When I said that I love you I meant
                   G
That I love you forever

              C       F     G
And I'm gonna keep on lovin you
               C    F             G
Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
Am           
I don't wanna sleep
             G
I just wanna keep on lovin you
