INTRO: Em  C   G   D  X 3 Then Em  C  G (going into D in verse) 


VERSE 1: 
 
D          Em   C
This is my life
     G           D
It's not what it was before
Em           C          G
All these feelings I've shared
    D         Em        C
And these are my dreams
      G         D
That I've never lived before
Em        C              D
Somebody shake me 'cause I
            C       D
I must be sleeping


CHORUS:

G                    D                 Em
  And now that we're here, it's so far away
         C                          G
All the struggle we thought was in vain
        D                    Em
All the mistakes one life contained
          C                   G  
They all finally start to go awayyy
                   D                  Em
And now that we're here, it's so far away
      C                         G 
And I feel like I can face the day
             D                  Em
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
           C                 (LET THE C RING INTO THE Em)
To be the person I am today


VERSE 2:
                 Em    C
And these are my words
     G          D 
That I've never said before
Em          C      G
I think I'm doing okay
D               Em       C
And this is the smile
    G           D
That I've never shown before
Em        C              D
Somebody shake me 'cause I
            C       D
I must be sleeping


CHORUS:

G                    D                 Em
  And now that we're here, it's so far away
         C                          G
All the struggle we thought was in vain
        D                    Em
All the mistakes one life contained
          C                   G  
They all finally start to go awayyy
                   D                  Em
And now that we're here, it's so far away
      C                         G 
And I feel like I can face the day
             D                  Em
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
            C
To be the person I am today

I'm so afraid of waking, Please don't shake me
 Em    G  C  D     C     Em   D
Afraid of waking, Please dont shake me


CHORUS:

G                    D                 Em

All the struggle we thought was in vain
            D                    Em

And I feel like I can face the day
             D                  Em
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
            C
To be the person I am today
