Verse 3
-------
She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me

She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

Pre-Chorus

And I want you to know I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say, do you know what I'm saying
But I need more

There's lots and lots for us to do
