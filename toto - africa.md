# Toto - Africa

```
A | C#m || x4

B                   D#m     G#m
I hear the drums echoin tonight
B               A             C#m         G#m   A  C#m
She has only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
B                D#m           G#m          B
She's coming in twelve thirthy flight   the moolight winds
     A                      C#m7              G#m   A  C#m
     Reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
B              D#m             G#m
I stopped an old man along the way
B                   A             C#m              G#m   A C#m
Hoping to find some old forgotten words of ancient melo-dies
B              D#7       G#m                 A                C#m
He turned to me as if to say  hurry boy it's waiting there for you

Chorus:

     F#m           D               A       E
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
     F#m                     D             A             E
     There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do       MTM
     F#m          D              A   E
     I bless the rains down in   Africa
     F#m             D               A        C#m E F#m  A C#m
     Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

B                 D#m         G#m
The wild dogs cry out in the night
B            A                    C#m            G#m   A  C#m
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
B          D#m               G#m
I know that I must do what's right
B                     A          C#m                  G#m   A  C#m
Sure as kilimangiaro rises like olimpus above the seranget-ti
     B         D#7               G#m
     I seek to cure what's deep inside
G#m                 A               C#m
Frightened of this thing that I've become

Chorus:

     F#m         D             A       E
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
     F#m                   D             A             E
     There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
     F#m        D             A   E
     I bless the rains down in   Africa
     F#m           D              A        C#m E F#m  A C#m
     Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

B   D#7     G#m             A              C#m
               hurry boy it's waiting there for you
     F#m         D             A       E
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
     F#m                   D             A             E
     There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

     I bless the rains down in   Africa [REPEAT X4]
     F#m           D              A        C#m E F#m  A C#m
