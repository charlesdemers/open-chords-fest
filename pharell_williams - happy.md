Capo 1


 Em                                          Em  A  B    A  
    It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
 Em                                          Em  A  B    A
    Sunshine she's here,  You can take a break
          Em                                    Em  A  B    A
    I'm a hot air balloon, That could go to space
             Em                                     Em  A  B    A
    With the air, Like I don't care,  Baby by the way

                C                Bm                   Bm             E
  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel, Like a room without a roof
                C                Bm                   Bm              E
  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel like, Happiness is the truth
                C                Bm                   Bm            E
  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you know what, Happiness is to you
                C                Bm                 Bm                     E

 Em                                         Em A B    A
    Here come bad news, Talking this and that
 Em                                         Em A B    A
    Give me all you got,  Don't hold it back
 Em                                                  Em A  B   A
    Well I should probably warn you,  I'll be just fine
 Em                                          Em  A  B    A
    No offense to you,  Don't waste your time
