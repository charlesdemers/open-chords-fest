Verse

Our lives built on tin cans and string
E                  Esus
But the cornerstone laid is a wondrous and beautiful thing
        E                     Esus                   A
Sure in the ground
                   E    Esus
While the North wind is taking it's toll
E                       Esus
You have helped me to find my way back and to anchor my soul
         E                        Esus                  A
Safe in the sound
                  E    Esus

Chorus

   Oh you know me
C#
   Oh and I know you
A                   E    Esus
   And I know that
C#
   We can see this through
A                          (Transition using A into next verse)


Verse

I'm brack and baring my bones
Said if we heard the howling
I'd run out to face it alone
To meet it half way

But I've still got badges to earn
So keep sifting my soul
Cause I think that I'm starting to learn
To love you that way


Chorus (transition into bridge with E > Esus rather than A at end of chorus)


Bridge

  It's true that you could snap my neck
G#                         A       C#
I trust you'll save my life instead
G#                     A (into normal chord from power chord)


Verse

Cause our love is a loyalty sworn
If we hold to our hope
Then I know we can weather the storm
Whatever they say
Come what may

Chorus (end on E rather than Esus)
