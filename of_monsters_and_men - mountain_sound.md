Intro (played over picking bit):

F - Am - C  x2


  Dm                        Fmaj7
I heard them calling in the distance
     Am                   G
So I packed my things and ran
Dm                    Fmaj7
Far away from all the trouble
      Am                 G
I had caused with my two hands
                  Dm                    Fmaj7
Alone we traveled on with nothing but a shadow
   Am        G
We fled far away


F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       C
Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       G
Through the woods we ran


Dm                          Fmaj7
Some hid scars and some hid scratches
           Am                 G
It made me wonder about their past
                Dm                Fmaj7
And as I looked around I began to notice
             Am               G
That we were nothing like the rest


F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       C
Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       G
Through the woods we ran


F     Am        C
      Wooooah      (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F     Am        C
      Wooooah      (We sleep until the sun goes down)

Dm - F - Am - C

Dm - F - Am - C
     Wooooah
                   (We sleep until the sun goes down)

F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       C
Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       G
Through the woods we ran

F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       C
Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
F         Am     C
Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
F           Am       G
Through the woods we ran


F        Am      C
La la la Wooooah La la la (We sleep until the sun goes down)

F        Am      C
La la la Wooooah La la la (We sleep until the sun goes...)
