# Our Lady Peace - 4am

```
Capo 1

Intro: Bm, G, Bm, G

Verse 1:
 

Bm                        G
I walked around my good intentions

                          Bm
and found that there were none

Bm                          G
I blame my father for the wasted years

             Bm
We hardly talked



Bm                        G
I never thought I would forget this hate

      E                                G
Then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong

Chorus:

D           G        A                          D
If I don't make it, know that I loved you all along

D           G    A                    D
Just like sunny days that we ignore because

D          G        A
We're all dumb and jaded

A      C             C/Em              A
and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong....



Verse 2:


 Bm                            G                           Bm
I walked around my room not thinking, just sinking in this box

Bm                        G                      Bm
I blame myself for being too much like somebody else

Bm                            G
I never thought I would just bend this way

         E                             G
Then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong....Chorus...

Instrumental: D, C, G, C, A, D, A, D, A, C  ( x2 )


        C            C/Em               A
And I hope to God I figure out what's wrong...

       C             C/Em               A
And I hope to God I figure out what's wrong...

....Chorus....Chorus
