# Goo Goo Dolls - Before itâ€™s too late

```
Verse:
  F                G          Am           G
I wondered through fiction to look for the truth
F      G               F
Buried beneath all the lies
                 G
And I stood at a distance
   Am           G
To feel who you are
F        G            C
Hiding myself in your eyes


Chorus:
    F    G    Am            G
And hold on before it's too late
 F       G             Am
Until we leave this behind
F     G         Am         G
Don't fall just be who you are
F                G           C
It's all that we need in our lives


Bridge:
   Am            C
So live like you mean it
G            F
Love til you feel it
     Am          C           G
It's all that we need in our lives
   Am           C
So stand on the edge with me
G              F
Hold back your fear and see
Am         G             C
Nothing is real til it's gone


Outro:
     F           G           Am
It's all that we need in our lives
     F          G          C
It's all that I need in my life
