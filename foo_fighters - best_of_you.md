                       C#                
I've got another confession to make
           A       
I'm your fool
                        C#             
Everyone's got their chains to break
           A                 
Holdin' you


                    B               A           
Were you born to resist or be abused?
                       C#                   Eb/E                A    A        
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
                       C#                   Eb/E                A    A     
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
C#                Eb/E            A         
Are you gone and onto someone new?


                        C#           
I needed somewhere to hang my head
                A              
Without your noose
                               C#            
You gave me something that I didn't have
             A    
But had no use
                       B    
I was too weak to give in
                 A  
Too strong to lose
                     C#          
My heart is under arrest again
                A     
But I break loose
                     C#               
My head is giving me life or death
               A    
But I can't choose
                    B         
I swear I'll never give in
        A    
No I refuse


                       C#                  Eb/E                    A  F#      
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
                         C#      
Has someone taken your faith?
               Eb/E             
Its real, the pain you feel
      
        A               
You trust, you must
      F#          
Confess
