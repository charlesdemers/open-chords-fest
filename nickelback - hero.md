|G#m                       |E
    I am so high I can here heavean
|G#m                       |E
    I am so high I can hear heaven
              
                                        
              |G           A                 |E
    Whoa, but heaven...no, heaven don't hear me

                       |G
    And they say that a hero could save us
        A                       |B
    I'm not gonna stand here and wait
                       |G
    I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles 
    A                   |E
    Watch as we all fly away

|G#m                              |E
    Someone told me love would all save us
|G#m                                  |E
    But how can that be look what love gave us
                   |G                 A
    A world full of killing and blood spilling
                    |E
    That world never came

                       |G
    And they say that a hero could save us
        A                       |B
    I'm not gonna stand here and wait
                       |G
    I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles 
    A                   |E
    Watch as we all fly away

    |G-A   |B(just 2 beats, not 4)  |G-A    |E
                |G 
    Now that the world isn't ending 
         A                       |B
    It's love that I'm sending to you
                |G
    It isn't the love of a hero 
        A                         |E
    And that's why I fear it won't do

                       |G
    And they say that a hero could save us
        A                       |B
    I'm not gonna stand here and wait
                       |G
    I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles 
    A                   |E
    Watch as we all fly away






    And they're watching us
|G
    They're watching us
A                 |B
    As we all fly away


    And they're watching us
|G
    They're watching us
A                 |B
    As we all fly away


    And they're watching us
|G
    They're watching us
A                 |E   A   E
    As we all fly away

|G |
