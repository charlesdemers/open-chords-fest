# Bryan Adams - Heaven

```
C   Am                     G                        Dm           Am
 Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years, there was only you and me,

         A#             Am  G     C   Am                    G
 we were young and wild and free. Now nothin' can take you away from me,

            Dm               Am               A#        Am
 we've been down that road before, but that's over now,

             G
 you keep me comin' back for more.

|  Baby you're all that I want, when you're lyin' here in my arms,
|
|      F          G         Am                 G
|  I'm findin' it hard to believe, we're in heaven.

|     F         G       Am               G
|  It isn't too hard to see, we're in heaven.

 C   Am                    G                      Dm               Am
 Oh, once in your life you find someone, who will turn your world around,

           A#                 Am  G     C   Am
 Bring you up when you're feelin' down. Ya, nothin' could change

          G                      Dm                Am
 what you mean to me. Oh there's lots that I could say,

          A#          Am           G
 but just hold me now,   cause our love will light the way.



 [Repeat Chorus]



 Dm                Em       F                   G  Am
 I've been waitin' for  so  long, for somethin' to arrive,

                        Em[2]   C   Dm                 Em       F
 For love to come along.            Now our dreams are comin'   true,

                            G   Am   G       Am  G
 Through the good times and the bad, Ya, I'll be standin' there by you.



 [Repeat Chorus]



 Am  G
