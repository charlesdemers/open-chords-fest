# Tal Bachman - Sheâ€™s So High

```
A            E         D
She's blood, flesh and bone 
A           E     D   
No tucks or silicone
A              E             D           A
She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound 

     E                  D    
But somehow I can't believe 
                        A 
That anything should happen 
E                   D  
I know where I belong 
                     A
And nothing's gonna happen 
    E    
Yeah, yeah 

(Chorus): 

                  Bm  D
'Cause she's so high... 
        A                E      
High above me, she's so lovely 
           Bm   D     
She's so high... 
         A               E            Bm D  A  E
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite 
          Bm  D    
She's so high... 
         A
High above me 

(verse 2)
 
First class and fancy free 

She's high society 

She's got the best of everything 


What could a guy like me 

Ever really offer? 

She's perfect as she can be 

Why should I even bother? 


(Repeat Chorus) 


She comes to speak to me 

I freeze immediately 

'Cause what she says sounds so unreal 


But somehow I can't believe 

That anything should happen 

I know where I belong 

And nothing's gonna happen 

Yeah, yeah 

Yeah, yeah 

(Repeat Chorus)
