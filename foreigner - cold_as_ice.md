Ebm                     B                                     Ebm  B
You're as cold as ice, youre willing to sacrifice our love
  Ebm                              B                   Abm
You never take advice, someday you’ll pay the price, I know
       F#                       Bbm
Ive seen it before, it happens all the time
            Ebm                                B
Youre closing the door, you leave the world behind
          F#                            Bbm
Youre digging for gold, youre throwing away
   Ebm                                    B     Ebm  B
A fortune in feelings, but someday youll pay
Ebm                    B                                     Ebm  B
You’re as cold as ice, you’re willing to sacrifice our love
Ebm                      B                            Abm
You want paradise, but someday you’ll pay the price, I know
F#                                       Bbm
Ive seen it before, it happens all the time
            Ebm                                B
Youre closing the door, you leave the world behind
        F#m                             Bbm
Youre digging for gold, youre throwing away
  Ebm                                    B
A fortune in feelings, but someday youll pay

Cold    as     ice - you know that you are
Ebm    Bb       B
Cold    as     ice - as cold as ice to me

Ebm                    B                  Ebm    B     
Youre as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know, oh yes I know

Youre as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know, oh yes I know
Ebm               B      
Youre as cold as ice...
