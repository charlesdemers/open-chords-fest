# Tears for Fears - Mad World

```
Verse 1:
Am                   C
All around me are familiar faces.
G                 D
Worn out places.  Worn out faces.
Am                         C
Bright and early for their daily races.
G               D
Going nowhere.  Going nowhere.
Am                          C
And their tears are filling up their glasses.
G               D
No expression.  No expression.
Am                      C
Hide my head; I want to drown my sorrow.
G             D
No tomorrow.  No tomorrow.

Chorus:
Am                  D
And I find it kinda funny.
                Am
I find it kinda sad.
                        D
The dreams in which I'm dying
                       Am
Are the best I've ever had.
                  D
I find it hard to tell you,
                      Am
'Cause I find it hard to take.
                   D
When people run in circles it's a very, very...

Am C   D
   Mad world.
Am C   D
   Mad world
Am C   D
   Mad world.
Am C   D
   Mad world.

Verse 2:
Am                       C
Children waiting for the day they feel good.
G                D
Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.
Am                        C
Made to feel the way that every child should.
G                D
Sit and listen.  Sit and listen.
Am                       C
Went to school and I was very nervous.
G                D
No one knew me.  No one knew me.
Am                     C
Hello, teacher tell me what's my lesson?
G                       D
Look right through me.  Look right through me.

Chorus:
Am                  D
And I find it kinda funny.
                Am
I find it kinda sad.
                        D
The dreams in which I'm dying
                       Am
Are the best I've ever had.
                  D
I find it hard to tell you,
                      Am
'Cause I find it hard to take.
                   D
When people run in circles it's a very, very...


Am C   D
   Mad world.
Am C   D
   Mad world.
Am C   D
   Mad world.
Am C   D
   Mad world. 
(At the end here, on the last 'world' I like to finish on A (major) chord instead
of D, I feel it ends the piece better and sounds more meaningful... but that's just me!)
