  me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard

Bm                 A              D                       G
  standing on your mamma's porch - you told me that you'd wait forever
Bm           A               D                   G

  man we were killin' time
          C                       Bb
  we were young and reckless - we needed to unwind
F         Bb                  C
  i guess nothing can last forever...

  D* A* D* A*

  and now the times are changin'

  sometimes when i play my old six string
A*
  i think about you wonder what went wrong

Bm                 A              D                 G
  standing on your manna's porch - you told me it'd last forever
Bm           A               D                   G
  and when i held your hand - i knew that it was now or never
Bm               A                    D* A*                       D*  A*
