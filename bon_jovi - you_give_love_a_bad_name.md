An angel's smile is what you sell, you promise me heaven, then put me through hell
  Em                                   Em
Chains of love got a hold on me, when passion's a prison, you can't break free


A                       Em (riff) D
Oh you're a loaded gun yeah,      oh there's nowhere to run
A                        B
No one can save me, the damage is done

Paint your smile on your lips, blood red nails on your fingertips
    Em                                      Em
A school boy's dream, you act so shy, your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye 


A                       Em (riff) D
Oh you're a loaded gun yeah,     oh there's nowhere to run
