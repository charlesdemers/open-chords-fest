Intro: Am C G Bb

Am      C                     G      Bb                Am
 Do you worry that you're not liked, how long till you break
       C               G          Bb               Am
You're happy cause you smile, but how much can you fake
   C        G      Bb       Am
An ordinary boy an ordinary name
    C          G              Bb
But ordinary's just not good enough today

Bridge:
Am         C          G          Bb
Ow a whoo, Ow a whoo, ow a whoo
Am         C          G          Bb
Ow a whoo, Ow a whoo, ow a whoo

Am           C                  G               Bb
Alone alone alone, alone alone alone alone alone


Chorus:
             Am    C   G    Bb     Am
I'm thinking why       is superman dead
C   G     Bb    Am
    Is it in my head
C   G          Bb      Am
    We'll just laugh instead
C      G                                      Bb
   You worry about the weather and Whether or not you should hate

Am      C                  G      Bb              Am
Are you worried about your faith, kneel down and obey
       C               G         Bb              Am
You're happy you're in love, you need someone to hate
   C        G       Bb       Am
An ordinary girl an ordinary waist
    C          G              Bb
But ordinary's just not good enough today
Am           C                  G               Bb
Alone alone alone, alone alone alone alone alone
