Em7        G                             Dsus4                  A7sus4
  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
Em7          G                     Dsus4               A7sus4
  By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
Em7                  G       Dsus4           A7sus4

Verse 2
-------
Em7              G                              Dsus4                A7sus4
   Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
Em7                G                           Dsus4              A7sus4
   I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
Em7                  G       Dsus4           A7sus4
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Em7   G     Dsus4     A7sus4
about you now


Pre-chorus
----------
     Cadd9            Dsus4            Em7
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    Cadd9               Dsus4             Em7
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
Cadd9          Dsus4
There are many things that I
      G       Dsus4/F#  Em7        G         A7sus4
would like to say to    you but I don't know how
Chorus
------
        Cadd9  Em7   G    Em7                        Cadd9    Em7   G
Because maybe           You're gonna be the one that saves me
   Em7       Cadd9   Em7   G         Em7          Cadd9  Em7   G  Em7
And after all                You're my wonderwall

(hold Em7, then silence)

Em7        G                             Dsus4                  A7sus4
  Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
Em7        G                        Dsus4                  A7sus4
  By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
Em7                  G       Dsus4           A7sus4

And all the lights that light the way are blinding
Cadd9          Dsus4
There are many things that I

would like to say to you, but I don't know how

And after all

You're my wonderwall
Repeat twice

I said maybe (I said maybe)

        Em7                   Cadd9               Em7      G
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        Em7                   Cadd9               Em7      G
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
