```
Intro: Em''D G''' C' Em''D Em''' 

Verse:
Em                 D      G   
I've gotta take a little time
          C                   Em   D 
A little time to think things over
Em                D        G   
I better read between the lines
           C               Em    D             
In case I need it when I'm older

Em                D        G
Now this mountain I must climb
                C              Em
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Em                    D         G
Through the clouds I see love shine
             C                 Em
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

Pre-chorus:
       Am                D             Am
In my life there's been heartache and pain
                       D        Am
I don't know if I can face it again
                      D          Am 
Can't stop now I've travelled so far
     C     G/B Am      Am 
To change this lonely life

Chorus:
G                    Em  D 
I want to know what love is
Am         Em       D
I want you to show me
G                    Em  D
I want to feel what love is
Am         Em        D  D7  Em 
I know you can show me

Verse:
Em                D      G  
I'm gonna take a little time
          C             Em      D
A little time to look around me
Em                D       G
I've got nowhere left to hide
               C                Em 
It looks like love has finally found me

Pre-chorus
