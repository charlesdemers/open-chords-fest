capo 3

D       C             G
Someday I will walk away
      D                 C              G
When time ain't drawing on me like a blade
D           C               G
Back turned to the setting sun
D                 C                 G
Leaving behind Toronto's incessant hum
       D      C         G
'Cause I was born and raised
   D C     G
To live beyond
D     C        G
 The heft and weight
      D C    G
Of a world undone

Em          D/F#          Gadd4  G
But I don't mean to be a bother
Em       D/F#               Gadd4    G
I don't need you to take my burden away
Em     D/F#           Gadd4  
And I ain't afraid of dying
 C   C/B   Am   
Cold and alone

D            C               G
Traipsing through the utter dark
 D            C               G
Walking underneath the dead moonlight
D       C           G
Without any great concern
     D                   C                     G
For what I've missed or how many bridges have burned
D        C         G
 Like a bird who flies
        D C           G
All the way from the north
D   C          G
My heart will roam
   D  C       G
In search of warmth

Em          D/F#          Gadd4  G
But I don't mean to be a bother
Em       D/F#               Gadd4    G
I don't need you to take my burden away
Em     D/F#           Gadd4  
And I ain't afraid of dying
 C   C/B   Am7   
Cold and alone
When my time comes
When I was young
                   Em
I didn't know too much
                        B7              C
I thought that I could rule the world
            Am7
Then I grew up
                      Em
I found out life was hard
              B7
Harder than stone 

C Am7 Em B7
