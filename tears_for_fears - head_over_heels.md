# Tears For Fears - Head Over Heels

```
A9   A         Cmaj7    C        
 I wanted to be with you alone
A9   A             Cmaj7    C
and talk about the weather
     A9              A                 Cmaj7          C   
but traditions i can trace against the child in your face
A9        A             Cmaj7  C
won't escape my attention
A9       A                    Cmaj7       C
you keep your distance with a system of touch
A9    A              Cmaj7  C
and gentle persuasion
     A9     A                  Cmaj7      C
i'm lost in admiration could i need you this much?
               A9      A               Cmaj7  C
oh you're just wasting my time, you're just, just wasting time.

CHORUS:

G                         Em
something happens and i'm head over heels
        G                Em  
I never find out til i'm head over heels
G                         Em 
something happens and i'm head over heels
          Dm7
Ah, don't take my heart don't break my heart
                       A9  A  Cmaj7 C
don't don't throw it away.

I made a fire and watching it burn
thought of your future
with onre foot in the past now just how long will it last
no, no, no have you no ambition
my mother and my brothers used breathing clean air
and dreaming i'm a doctor
it's hard to be a man when there's agun in your hand
oh I feel so
         D
this is my four leaf clover
  C
I'm on the line open mind
          D  
this is my four leaf clover
C              D        C
la, la, la, la, la, la, la ....
      D            C
in my minds's eye one little boy one little man
         D
funny how time flies
