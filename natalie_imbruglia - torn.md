```
CAPO ON 5
(This is my verison, I find it easier to play then the other tabs on here.) :) 

Verse 1:

          C                                      Em
            I thought I saw a man brought to life

                                                     F
            He was warm, he came around like he was dignified

       
            He showed me what it was to cry

          C                                       Em
            Well you couldn't be that man I adored

                   
            You don't seem to know 

                                         F
            Don't seem to care what your heart is for 


            But I don't know him anymore 



Pre Chorus 1:

                         Am
                 There's nothing where he used to lie 

                G 
                 My conversation has run dry 

               Em
                 That's what's going on 

               G                       
                 Nothing's fine

                       C 
                 I'm torn



Chorus 1:

          (C)                  G                  Am
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               F                           C
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 

                               G                      Am
                Illusion never changed, into something real 

                                F                              C
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn

                              G                  Am  (G)  F
             You're a little late, I'm already torn 



Verse 2:

           C                                    Em
            So I guess the fortune teller's right

                                                                F
            I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

  
            But you crawl beneath my veins and now
  


Pre Chorus 2:                          


                  Am
                 I don't care, I have no luck

                  G
                 I don't miss it all that much 

                 Em
                 There's just so many things

                 G
                 That I can't touch

                      C
                 I'm torn



Chorus 2:

            (C)                  G                  Am
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               F                           C
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 

                               G                      Am
                Illusion never changed, into something real 

                                F                              C
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn

                              G                  Am  (G)  F
             You're a little late, I'm already torn        



Bridge:

             Am  (G)  F        Am            C         G
           Torn...             Ooooh...  Hoo ooooh...  Ooooh



Pre Chorus 3:


                 Am
                 There's nothing where he used to lie

                 G
                 My inspiration has run dry

                 Em
                 That's what's going on

                 G
                 Nothing's right

                 C
                 I'm torn



Chorus 3:

          (C)                    G                Am
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               F                          C
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 

                               G                      Am
             Illusion never changed, into something real 

                                F                              C
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn

                                 G                Am    
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

                               F                              C
             I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor

                              G                  Am  (G)  F
             You're a little late, I'm already torn 



Outro:

          Am   G
          Torn...            

          Am
          Ooh...
