# Blue October - Hate Me

```
Intro:

G   Em   C   D

G
I have to block out thoughts of you 

so I dont lose my head 
Em
they crawl in like a cockroach 

leaving babies in my bed 
C
Dropping little reels of tape 

To remind me I'm alone 
D
Playing movies in my head 

That make a porno feel like home 

G
There's a burning in my pride 

A nervous bleeding in my brain 
Em
And ounce of pieces is all I want for you 

Will you never call again 

C
And will you never say that you loved me 

Just to put it in my face 
D
Will you never try to reach me 

It is I that wanted space 

         G
Hate Me today 
         Em   
Hate me tomorrow 
            C               D                   G     
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you 

G
I'm sober now for 3 whole months 

It's one accomplishment that you helped me with 
Em
One thing that always tore us apart 

Is the one that I won't touch again 

C
In a sick way I want to thank you 

For holding my head up late at night 
D
While I was busy waging wars with myself 

You were trying to stop the fight 

G
You never doubted my warped opinions 

On things like suicide or hate 
Em
You made me compliment myself 

When it was way too hard to take 
C
So I'll drive so fucking far away 

That I never cross your mind 
D
And do whatever it takes in your heart 

To leave me behind 
      
        G  
Hate Me today 
        Em
Hate me tomorrow 
            C   
Hate me for all the things 
    D         Em
I didn't do for you 

           G
Hate me in ways 
             Em
Yeah ways hard to swallow 
         C                 D                   G
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you 

           C                               D
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave 
             G                               Em               
I'm kicking shadows in the street for every mistake that I make 
       C                      D
Like a baby boy I never was a man 
       G                                     Em
Til I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand 

          C                             D
And the I found I'm yelling make it go away 
             G                                  Em 
just make it stop and let it shine just like it used to be 
         C                                      D
And then she whispered "how can you do this to me?" 

        G
Hate Me today 
        Em 
Hate me tomorrow 
             C
Hate me for all the things 
   D            Em
I didn't do for you 
           G
Hate me in ways 
                Em
Yeah ways hard to swallow 
           C                D                  G  
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
