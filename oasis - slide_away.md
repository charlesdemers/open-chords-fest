Verse 1:
Am7             G                  Fmaj7
Slide away, and give it all you've got
Am7       G                Fmaj7
My today, fell in from the top
Am7                 G                  Fmaj7
I dream of you, and all the things you say
Am7                        G  Fmaj7
I wonder where you are now

Am7           G                Fmaj7
Hold me down, all the world's asleep
Am7                 G               Fmaj7
I need you now, you knock me off my feet
Am7                    G               Fmaj7
I dream of you, and we talk of growing old
Am7                       G  Fmaj7
But you said please don't

Together we'll fly
G       Fmaj7

But I don't know what you're saying to me


Chorus:

Now that you're mine
             G                  Fmaj7
we'll find a way Of chasing the sun
              Am7                   G
Let me be the one, that shines with you
       D7                             Fmaj7
In the morning, we don't know what to do
               C                  G
We're two of a kind, we'll find a way
                 Fmaj7
To do what we've done
              Am7                   G
Let me be the one, that shines with you
                  Fmaj7  D7sus4
