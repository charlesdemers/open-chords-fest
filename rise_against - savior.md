Capo 1

   Em                                 G
It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten
         C
What the color of her eyes were
        G            C
and her scars or how she got them
       Em                               G
As the telling signs of age rain down a single tear is dropping
            C                             G              D
Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten

Em G C G D 

            Em                       G
There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
             C                           G                    D
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
    Em                                   G
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
     C                                        G           D
Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

           C
So tell me now
              G                D      C
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
               D
cause' I don't know
                             Em
That's when she said I don't hate you boy
               G                                      C           G
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
              D          Em
That's when I told her I love you girl
                G                             C
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
G  D
Whoa whoa

Em G C G D

        Em
But the day pressed on like crushing weights
    G
For no man does it ever wait
     C
Like memories of dying days
     G              D
That deafen us like hurricanes
Em
Bathed in flames we held the brand
  G
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
C
Pressed into the flesh like sand
    G           D
Now do you understand?

           C
So tell me now
              G                D      C
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
               D
cause' I don't know
                             Em
That's when she said I don't hate you boy
               G                                      C           G
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
              D          Em
That's when I told her I love you girl
                G                             C
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
G  D
Whoa whoa

Em D

Em          G
1000 miles away
                        C
There's nothing left to say
                      G       D
But so much left that I don't know
Em             G
We never had a choice
                       C
This world is too much noise
                 G
It takes me under
            D           Em
It takes me under once again

Em D

        Em
I don't hate you
        G        D
I don't hate you no

           C
So tell me now
              G                D      C
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
       G       D
cause' I don't know
                             Em
That's when she said I don't hate you boy
               G                                      C       G
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save
              D          Em
That's when I told her I love you girl
                G                             C         G   D
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
        Em      G
I don't hate you
        C
I don't hate you, no
G  D    Em
Whoa whoa
