# Staind - Itâ€™s Been A While

```
VERSE:
Am              C                G      D       Am
Its been awhile since I could - hold my head up high
Am             C              G                   D       Am
Its been awhile since I first saw you   
Am             C               G           D            Am
Its been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
Am             C              G                 D    Am
Its been awhile since I could call you


CHORUS:
Am          C             G     D  Am             
And every thing I can't remember
Am           C                G D Am
As fucked up as it all may seem
Am           C                  G  D Am
The consequences that I've rendered
Am           C                G    D Am
I stretched myself beyond my means


VERSE:
Am             C                 G          D                 Am
Its been awhile since I couldn't say that I wasn't addicted
Am             C                 G            D                Am
Its been awhile since I couldn't say I love myself as well as
Am             C                    G                     D                 Am
Its been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
Am             C             G                 D                            Am
Its been awhile but all that shit seems to disappear when Im with you


CHORUS:
Am          C             G     D  Am             
And every thing I can't remember
Am           C                G D Am
As fucked up as it all may seem
Am           C                  G  D Am
The consequences that I've rendered
Am           C                G         D Am
Ive gone and fucked things up again    yea

Am    C               G  D
Why must I feel this way
Am    C             G  D 
Just make this go away
Am      C              G   D
Just one more peaceful day


VERSE:
Am             C            G  D             Am
Its been awhile since I could look at myself straight
Am             C                G            D   Am
Its been awhile since I said im sorry
Am             C                    G  D                  Am
Its been awhile since ive seen the way candles light your face
Am             C          G              D                Am
Its been awhile but I can still remember just the way you taste


CHORUS:
Am          C             G     D  Am             
And every thing I can't remember
Am           C                G      D              Am
As fucked up as it all may seem   to be I know its me
Am           C                  G  D Am
I can not blame this on my father
Am           C                G         D Am
He did the best he could for me  


OUTRO:
Am             C        G    D       Am
Its been awhile since I could hold my head up high
Am             C                G
Its been awhile since I said im sorry
