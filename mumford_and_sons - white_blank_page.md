Capo 2
Intro: Em,C,G,C,G,Em

Em
Can you lie next to her
Em                C    G      C    G
And give her your heart, your heart
G(Run down)     Em
As well as your body
Em
And can you lie next to her
Em               C   G      C   G
And confess your love, your love
G(Run down)     Em
As well as your folly
Em
And can you kneel before the king
Em          C   G      C   G
And say I’m clean, I’m clean

Chorus:
D           Em          C      D
But tell me now, where was my fault
D          Em      C         D
In loving you with my whole heart
D          Em         C      D
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
D         Em       C        D     Em,C,G,C,G,Em
In loving you with my whole heart

Em                                C  G  C  G(Run down)
A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
Em                                        C   G     C    G(Run down)
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, the brink
Em                                     C        G    C        G
You desired my attention but denied my affections, my affections

D       Em     C         D             Em       C        D
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
D       Em     C         D             Em       C        D
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
