# Jason Mraz - Iâ€™m Yours

```
Capo 4

Intro: G D Em C

     G
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it,
   D
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted,
  Em
I fell right through the cracks,

C
And now I'm tryin to get back....


            G
Before the cool done run out, Ill be givin it my bestest
    D
and Nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
    Em
I reckon it's again my turn,
    C           D
To Win some or learn some....


CHORUS:

G              D
But I wont hesitate
            Em
No more, No more
            C               G   D   Em   C
It can not wait; I'm yours


Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
Em                                     C                            A7
And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved.


CHORUS:
So I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait,
I'm sure

There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate,
I'm yours

G Bm 
Em                     D                            C
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       A7
And I will nibble your ear
G Bm Em D C A7

verse
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.


CHORUS:
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.

Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
There's no need to complicate.
'Cause our time is short.
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
           A7
I'm yours
