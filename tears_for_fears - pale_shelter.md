A  G  D  C  A  G  D  C  A  G  D  C  A  G

VERSE 1:
Fmaj7 
How can I be sure      
G6 
when your intrusionâ€™s my illusion? 
Fmaj7 
How can I be sure? 
G6 
when all the time you changed my mind 
Fmaj7 
I asked for more and more 
Am/D 
How can I be sure? 

CHORUS:    
                           A  
When you don't give me love      
      G             D      C 
(you give me Pale Shelter) 
                       A  
You don't give me love      
G             D      C 
(you give me cold hands)     
                A     G       D    C
And I can't operate on this failure      
                    A    G 
When all I want to be is    
D                 C    B7 
Completely in command   

VERSE 2: 
Fmaj7 
How can I be sure, 
G6
for all you say you keep me waiting 
Fmaj7 
How can I be sure, 
G6
when all you do is see me through 
Fmaj7 
I asked for more and more, 
Am/D 
How can I be sure   


VERSE 3:  
Fmaj7 
I've been here before, 
G6
there is no why, no need to try, 
Fmaj7 
I thought you had it all, 
G6
I'm calling you, I'm calling you, 
Fmaj7 
I ask for more and more, 
Am/D 
How can I be sure?
