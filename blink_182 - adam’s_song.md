# Blink 182 - Adamâ€™s Song

```
Verse 1
D           A           Bm
I never thought I'd die alone
      G                            D
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
               A           Bm
I trace the cord back to the wall
                    G                 D
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
           A               Bm
I took my time, I hurried up
                G                    D
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
           A             Bm
I'm too depressed to go on
            G
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

Chorus
D          Em               Bm 
I never conquered, rarely came
          G                D
16 just held such better days
          Em             Bm
Days when I still felt alive
             G              D
We couldn't wait to get outside
          Em               Bm
The world was wide, too late to try
          G                D
The tour was over we'd survived
            Em             Bm
I couldn't wait till I got home
             G                D
To pass the time in my room alone

Verse 2
D           A           Bm
I never thought I'd die alone
              G               D
Another six months I'll be unknown
               A                Bm
Give all my things to all my friends
                    G               D
You'll never step foot in my room again
               A               Bm
You'll close it off, board it up
               G                      D
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
           A           Bm
Of apple juice in the hall
              G                   D
Please tell mom this is not her fault

Chorus
D          Em               Bm 
I never conquered, rarely came
          G                D
16 just held such better days
          Em             Bm
Days when I still felt alive
          G                D
We couldn't wait to get outside
          Em             Bm
The world was wide, too late to try
     G                    D
The tour was over we'd survived
          Em             Bm
I couldn't wait till I got home
          G                D
To pass the time in my room alone

Chorus
D          Em               Bm 
I never conquered, rarely came
          G                D
tomorrow holds such better days
          Em             Bm
Days when I can still feel alive
          G                D
When I couldn't wait to get outside
          Em             Bm
The world is wide, the time goes by
          G                D
The tour is over, I've survived
          Em             Bm
I can't wait till I get home
          G                D
To pass the time in my room alone
