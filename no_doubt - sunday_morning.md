# No Doubt - Sunday Morning

```
Intro:  E C#m 8x

 
E          C#m        E C#m
Sappy pathetic little me
E            C#m            E  C#m
That was the girl I used to be
A          E (pause)
You had me on my knees
E C#m 2x

(Verse chords)
I'd trade you places any day
I'd never thought you could be that way
But you looked like me on Sunday
E C#m 2x A---

Chorus:
C#m                  E     A
You came in with the breeze
    C#m          E
On Sunday morning
              A             C#m 
You sure have changed since yesterday
        E     
Without any warning
A           C#m
I thought I knew you
A           C#m
I thought I knew you
A           C#m      E   C#m   E   C#m
I thought I knew you well. . . so well
E C#m 2x

(Verse Chords)
You're trying my shoes on for a change
They look so good but fit so strange
Out of fashion, so I can complain

(Repeat Chorus) A-- B--

Bridge:
C#m                              A E (same chords)
I know who I am, but who are you?
You're not looking like you used to
You're on the other side of the mirror
So nothing's looking quite as clear
Thank you for turning on the lights
Thank you, now you're the parasite
I didn't think you had it in you
And now you're looking like I used to

(Repeat Chorus
