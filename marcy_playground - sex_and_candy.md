 B             G             F#
Hangin' round downtown by myself
           B                        G           F#
and I had so much time to sit and think about myself
                    B
and then there she was
      G             F#
like double cherry pie
                B
yeah there she was
      G          F#
like disco super-fly

         -----riff-----  B  G     A
CHORUS:  I smell sex and candy here
                            B   G      A
         Who's that loungin' in my chair?
                           B          G             A
         Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
                                 D   A
         Mama this surely is a dream
       B                 G            D - A - B - G - F#
         Yeah mama this surely is a dream


Hanging round downtown by myself
and I've had too much caffeine and I was thinkin bout myself
and then there she was
in platform double suede
yeah there she was
like disco lemonade
