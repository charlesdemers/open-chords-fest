# Linkin Park - Crawling

```
Capo 4

Am             F
Crawling in my skin
      C                     G  
These wounds, they will not heal
Am            F
Fear is how I fall
   C              G 
Confusing what is real

Am                               F
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
C          G
Consuming, confusing
Am                           F  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
C
Controlling
G
I can't seem
   Am           F
To find myself again
                     Am         
My walls are closing in
                                       
(without a sence of confidence i'm convinced there's too much pressure to take)
Am                 F
I've felt this way before
       E
So insecure

Am             F 
Crawling in my skin
      C                     G
These wounds, they will not heal
Am            F
Fear is how I fall
   C              G 
Confusing what is real
Am                        F
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
C            G 
Distracting, reacting
Am                      F
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
C              G
It's haunting how I can't seem...

Am             F
To find myself again
                     Am
My walls are closing in

                                       
(without a sence of confidence i'm convinced there's too much pressure to take)

Am                 F
I've felt this way before
       E
So insecure
