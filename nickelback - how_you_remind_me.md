Verse 1
Bm                  E
 Never made it as a wise man
Asus2                    Dsus2
  I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
Bm                    E
 Tired livin' like a blind man
Asus2                        Dsus2
  I'm sick inside without a sense of feelin'

Pre-Chorus:
Bm           Dsus2     Asus2
And this is how you remind me
Bm        E         Asus2          Dsus2
 This is how you remind me of what I really am
Bm        E         Asus2          Dsus2
 This is how you remind me of what I really am

Chorus
Bm                Dsus2
 It's not like you   to say sorry
Asus2                 E
 Always waitin' on a different story
Bm             Dsus2
 This time I'm   mistaken
Asus2                 E
  For handin' you a heart worth breaking
Bm                  Dsus2               
And I've been wrong   I've been down
Asus               E
 To the bottom of every bottle
Bm            Dsus2       Asus2                E
  These five words in my head  scream "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Bm    E    Asus2
  Yet, yet, yet   
Dsus2               X 2
 No, no              


Verse 2
Bm                          E
 It's not like you didn't know that
Asus2                     Dsus2 
 I said I love you and I swear I still do
Bm                      E
 And it must have been so bad
Asus2                           Dsus2 
 Cause livin with me must have damn near killed you

Pre-Chorus:
Bm        E         Asus2          Dsus2
 This is how you remind me of what I really am
Bm        E         Asus2          Dsus2
 This is how you remind me of what I really am

Chorus
Bm                Dsus2
 It's not like you   to say sorry
Asus2                 E
 Always waitin' on a different story
Bm             Dsus2
 This time I'm   mistaken
Asus2                 E
  For handin' you a heart worth breaking
Bm                  Dsus2               
And I've been wrong   I've been down
Asus               E
 To the bottom of every bottle
Bm            Dsus2       Asus2                E
  These five words in my head  scream "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Bm    E    Asus2
  Yet, yet, yet   
Dsus2               X 4
 No, no

And I've been wrong   I've been down

 To the bottom of every bottle

 "Are we havin' fun yet?"
Bm    Dsus2  Asus2 [End]      
 Yet, Yet
