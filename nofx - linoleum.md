# NOFX - Linoleum

```
C                                  E
Possesions never meant anything to me
             AM
I'm not crazy
                G                 F        G
Well that's not true, I've got a bed, and a guitar
      C                              E
And a dog named Bob who pisses on my floor
                         AM
That's right, I've got a floor
    G       F         G
So what, so what, so what?
     C                    E
I've got pockets full of kleenex and lint and holes
      AM          G           F
Where everything important to me
               G                 C
Just seems to fall right down my leg
               E
And on to the floor
AM          G             F
My closest friend linoleum
G        C
Linoleum
E                 AM                    F
Supports my head, gives me something to believe
C                                      E
That's me on the beachside combing the sand
                  AM
Metal meter in my hand
                          F
Sporting a pocket full of change
C                                              E
That's me on the street with a violin under my chin
               AM                  F
Playing with a grin, singing gibberish
C                            E
That's me on the back of the bus
                 AM
That's me in the cell
                      F
That's me inside your head
                      C         E          AM       F
That's me inside your hhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaaaadddddd
                          C E AM F   (finish how ever u want
That's me inside your head
