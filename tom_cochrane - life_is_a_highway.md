```
Capo 3

Intro:
Bm  A   G  |
G  D/F# D  |  
G  D/F# A  | x2
G  D/F# A  |

G                              
Life's like a road that you travel on
             D
When there's one day here and the next day gone
    A
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand

Sometimes you turn your head to the wind
          G
There's a world outside every darkened door
      D
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
          A
Where the brave are free and lovers soar

Come ride with me to the distant shore

Bm
We won't hesitate
A
Break down the garden's gate
G                            Em
There's not much time left today

Chorus:
 Bm    A  G 
Life is a highway
G D/F#  D        G  D/F#  A     G  D/F#  A
I wanna ride it all night long
   Bm     A     G 
If you're going my way
G D/F#  D        G  D/F#  A     G  D/F#  A
I wanna drive it all night long

G
Through all these cities and all these towns
     D
It's in my blood and it's all around
  A
I love you now like I loved you then

This is the road and these are the hands
     G
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
    D
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
A
Knock me down back up again

You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

Bm
There's no load I can't hold
A
Road so rough this I know
G
I'll be there when the light comes in
     Em
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Chorus x2

Em          G                  Bm       A
There was a distance between you and I
Em           G                 Bm                    A
  A misunderstanding once, but now we look in the eye

Solo

Bm
There's no load I can't hold
A
Road so rough this I know
G
I'll be there when the light comes in
     Em
Just tell 'em we're survivors

N.C.
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long 

Chorus x2
