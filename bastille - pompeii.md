C-G-Em-D    X2


C          G         Em          D
I was left to my own de--v-i-c-e-s
C         G              Em         D
Many days fell away with nothing to show


C                           G
And the walls kept tumbling down
                   Em       D
In the city that we l-o-v-e-d
C                          G
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       Em      D
Bringing darkness from A-B-o-v-E


                      C
But if you close your eyes,
        G
Does it almost feel like
Em                 D
Nothing changed at all?
                      C
And if you close your eyes,
        G
Does it almost feel like
Em                D       
You've been here before?


C                    Em       D
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
C                    Em        D
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?


C              G              Em         D
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
C            G           Em             D
In your pose as the dust settles around us


C                           G
And the walls kept tumbling down
                    Em      D
In the city that we l-o-v-e-d
C                          G
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       Em      D
Bringing darkness from A-B]-o-v-E

                      C
But if you close your eyes,
        G
Does it almost feel like
Em                 D
Nothing changed at all?
                      C
And if you close your eyes,
        G
Does it almost feel like
Em                D       
You've been here before?


C                    G        D
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
C                    G        D
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

C              G
Oh where do we begin?
Em                D
The rubble or our sins?
