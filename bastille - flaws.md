# Bastille - Flaws

```
      C                                         G          C
when all of your flaws and all of my flaws are laid one by one
C       
wonderful part of the mess we made
      G                C
we pick ourselves undone
C                                                G                 C
all of your flaws and all of my flaws, they lie there hand in hand
C      
ones we've inherited ones that we learn
     G                  C
they pass from man to man

          Em         G 
there's a hole in my soul
         C                   D
i can't fill it i can't fill it
              Em         G
and there's a hole in my soul
        C                     D
can you fill it? can you fill it?

G               C         D               Em
you have always worn you flaws upon your sleeve
    G              C           D                 G
and i have always buried them deep beneath the ground
          C
dig them out
        G             D
let's finish what we started
         C
dig them out
   G                D
so nothing's left untouched

C                                            G              C
all of your flaws and all of my flaws, they may have been exude
C                            G   
we'll see that we need them to be who we are
C
without them we'd be doomed

          Em         G 
there's a hole in my soul
         C                  D
i can't fill it i can't fill it
              Em         G
and there's a hole in my soul
        C                     D
can you fill it? can you fill it?

G               C         D               Em
you have always worn you flaws upon your sleeve
    G              C           D                 G
and i have always buried them deep beneath the ground
          C
dig them out
        G             D
let's finish what we started
         C
dig them out
   G                D
so nothing's left untouched

      C                                             G
when all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted   X2
