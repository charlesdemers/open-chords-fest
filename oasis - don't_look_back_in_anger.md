C 	F	C	F

Verse 1
-------
C               G            Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E                F
Don't you know you might find
G                     C      Am G  [play these 2 chords quickly]
   A better place to play
C             G            Am
You said that you'd never been
            E                   F
But all the things that you've seen
G               C     Am G
   Slowly fade away


Pre-Chorus
----------
F		    Fm           C
  So I start a revolution from my bed
        F                 Fm            C
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
F                 Fm              C      
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
G                  
Stand up beside the fireplace
G#/E
Take that look from off your face
    Am             G2            F2              G2
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut

[NOTE: The G#/E chord could possibly also be played as G#/E7 (420100) and 
I actually saw this chord tabbed in a guitar magazine  as (xx0101)!]

Chorus
------
C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
          G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by
    C    G        Am  E                F             G 
Her soul slides away,   but don't look back in anger
             C     G    Am    E    F    G     C     Am G
I heard you say


Verse 2
-------
[same chords are used as in verse 1]

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows, if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away

Pre-Chorus
----------
[same chords as first pre-chorus]

Gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from of your face
Cos you ain't never gonna burn my heart out

Chorus again:
-------------
So sally can wait, she knows it's too late 
as she's walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
I heard you say

Guitar Solo
-----------
[solo played over the chords from the pre-chorus]

[Chorus again]

[Chorus again] but this time the song ends with:

C        G        Am
Her soul slides away   [long pause]

[sing the following parts moderately slow and play the guitar slowly one 
time]
               F
But don't look back in anger
           Fm
Don't look back in anger  [pause]
	    C    G   Am   E   F   G             C
I heard you say			     least not today
