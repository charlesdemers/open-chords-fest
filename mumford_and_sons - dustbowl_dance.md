Capo 1


    Bm        G             A           D
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
    Em        Bm            Em         F#
The days were short and the father was gone
          Bm            G        A             D
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
     Em           Bm             Em           F#
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield

          Bm            G           A         D
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
    Em          Bm               Em               F#
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
  Bm            G            A            D
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
     Em      Bm               Em       F#
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
   Bm           G              A         D
So collect your courage and collect your horse
     Em            Bm             Em        F#
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

Bm      G         A        D
Seal my heart and brake my pride
     Em         Bm            Em         F#
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
 Bm      G         A        D
Align my heart, my body, my mind
   Em             Bm       Em    F#
To face what I've done and do my time

      Bm        G            A          D
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Em             Bm            Em        F#
Your opression reeks of your greed and disgrace
   Bm      G         A         D
So one man has and another has not
Em          Bm           Em          F#
How can you love what it is you have got
         Bm          G             A            D
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Em        Bm                   Em         F#
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store

      Bm          G           A            D
There will come a time I will look in your eye
    Em               Bm           Em         F#
You will pray to the God that you always denied
    Bm          G             A      D
The I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
               Em      Bm               Em   F#
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

Bm      G         A        D
Seal my heart and brake my pride
     Em         Bm            Em         F#
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
 Bm      G         A        D
Align my heart, my body, my mind
   Em             Bm       Em    F#
To face what I've done and do my time

(2x)

     Bm       G        A          D
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
  Em             Bm            Em             F#
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
Bm         G          A      D
I went out back and I got my gun
             Em      Bm               Em   F#
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
