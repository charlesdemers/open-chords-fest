Intro : Em  Em  Em/C  Asus2 (2x)

Em                         G
Breathe your smoke into my lungs
Em                                G                                      
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun
Em                       G
Still not too old to die young
           C      G        D
The lovers hold on to everything
           C      G      D
And others hold on to anything
 
Am            C                    Em
I chased your love around a figure 8
           D
I need you more than I can take
Am              C              Em
You promised forever and a day
             D
And then you take it all away

Am  C  Em  D (2x)


 
Em                      G
Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Em
Then you vanish me
    G
I'm buried in the snow
Em                              G
But something tells me I'm not alone
           C      G        D
But lovers hold on to everything
           C      G       D
And others hold on to anything

 
Chorus 1x

---- Em  Em  Em/C Em/C  Asus2 Asus2 ----

           C      G         D
So, Lovers hold on to everything
           C      G   D
And others hold to anything [3x]

 
Chorus 2x
