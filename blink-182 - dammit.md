C/G G Am F (Play Twice) (Play the rhythm like the first part of the intro.)

Verse 1:

C/G
  It's alright
G
  to tell me
Am
  what you think
F
  about me
C/G
  I won't try
G
  to argue
Am
  or hold it

  against you
C/G
  I know that
G
  you're leaving
Am
  you must have
F
  your reasons
C'G
  The season
G
  is calling
Am
  and your pictures
F
  are falling down

Interlude:

C/G G Am F (2xs) (Play the rhythm like the intro)

Verse 2:

C/G
  The steps that
G
  I retrace
Am
  the sad look
F
  on your face
C/G
  The timing
G
  and structure
Am
  did you hear
F
  he fucked her?
C/G
  A day late
G
  a buck short
Am
  I'm writing
F
  the report
C/G
  On losing
G
  and failing
Am
  when I move
F
  I'm flailing now

Chorus:

C/G
  And it'll happen once again
G
  I'll turn to a friend
Am
  Someone that understands,
F
  Sees through the master plan
C/G
  But everybody's gone
G
  And I've been here for too long
Am
  To face this on my own
F
  Well I guess this is growing up

(Play the next part of the chorus like the verses.)

C/G G Am             F
        Well I guess this is growing up

Interlude:

C G Am F (Play once)

Verse 3:

C/G
  And maybe
G
  I'll see you
Am
  at a movie
F
  sneak preview
C/G
  You'll show up
G
  and walk by
Am
  on the arm
F
  of that guy
C/G
  And I'll smile
G
  and you'll wave
Am
  we'll pretend
F
  it's okay
C/G
  The charade
G
  it won't last
Am
  when he's gone
F
  I won't come back

Chorus:

C/G
  And it'll happen once again
G
  I'll turn to a friend
Am
  Someone that understands,
F
  Sees through the master plan
C/G
  But everybody's gone
G
  And I've been here for too long
Am
  To face this on my own

(I play the F chord till I get to "this" and stop playing. I think it makes
 a good transition to get to the bridge easier.)
F
  Well I guess this is growing up

Bridge:

e-------------------------------------------------|
B-------------------------------------------------|
G-------------------------------------------------|
D--2------0--2------2---------0-2---0-2----2------|
A----3---------3------3-----------3-----3----3----|

e------------------------------------|
B------------------------------------|
G------------------------------------|
D--2------0--2------2---------0-2----|
A----3---------3------3-----------3--|
E------3----------------3------------|

then stike the C/G chord once and just sing the first part of the Outro
with no playing.

Outro:

N.C.
Well, I guess this is growing up

(Play the rest of the outro like the verses.)

C/G G Am              F
        Well, I guess this is growing up (Play 4xs)

End on C/G and let it ring out
