# Train - Drops Of Jupiter

```
C
Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
G                                   F
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey 
C
She acts like summer and walks like rain 
G                                        F
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey 
C
Since the return from her stay on the moon 
G                                                 F
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 

G                                D
Tell me did you sail across the sun 
                              F                              C
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 
And that heaven is overrated 
G                                      D
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
                          Dm
One without a permanent scar 
                                    
And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there 

C
Now that she's back from that soul vacation 
G                                           F
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey 
C
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo 
G                                      F
Reminds me that there's time to grow, hey, hey 
C
Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
G                                          F
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane 
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

G                                        D
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
                                   F                           C
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day            
And head back to the Milky Way 
G                                 D
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind 
                                 Dm
Was it everything you wanted to find 
                                    
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

                 C
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
G                                F
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong 
                    C                                 G
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation 
F
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 

G                                        D
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
                                F                               C
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
And head back toward the Milky Way 


G                                D
Tell me did you sail across the sun 
                              F                              C
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 
And that heaven is overrated 
G                                      D
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
                          Dm
One without a permanent scar 
                                    
And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there
