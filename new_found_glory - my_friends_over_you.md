Verse 1:
              D
I'm drunk off your kiss
     G
For another night in a row
                     D
This is becoming too routine for me
      Em             G
But I didn't mean to lead you on
         D                       G
And it's alright to pretend that we still talk
     D
It's just for show isn't it
Em                    G
It's my fault that it fell apart

Refrain:
     Em        G
Just maybe you need this
      Em     G       A
And I didn't mean to lead you on


Chorus:
D                     G
You were everything I wanted
    D            G
But I just can't finish what I started
        Bm                      G
There's no room left here on my back
                     Bm
It was damaged long ago
                              G
Though you swear that you are true
F#m Em    D    A(Hold)         D--G(Repeat Intro for guitar 2)
I'd still pick my friends over you
                D--G
My friends over you!


Verse 2:
               D
Please tell me everything
         G
That you think that I should know
              D
About all the plans you made
     Em             G
When I was no where to be found
         D                        G
And it's all right to forget that we still talk
     D
It's just for fun isn't it
Em                    G
It's my fault that it fell apart

And I didn't mean to lead you on
