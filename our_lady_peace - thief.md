D               A     Bm          G
I don't want to understand this horror

D         A               Bm  G
There's a weight in your eyes I can't admit

D         A       Bm       G
Everybody ends up here in bottles

D       A              Bm         G
But the name tags the last thing you wanted


BRIDGE 1:

A                G                   A

And we can't let go because this

There's a house built out in space...

    Em               C                  D             G
And I can't see that thief that lives inside of your head

    Em            C              G            D
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed

    Em                  C             D          G
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend

But I can be your, be your....

This disgusting arrangement ... time and the end

D               A        Bm         G
I don't want to hear who walked on water

D          A             Bm       G
'Cause the hallways are empty ... clocks tick


BRIDGE 2:

And we can't go home because this

There's a house built out in space...
