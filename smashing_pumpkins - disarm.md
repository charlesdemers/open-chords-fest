Disarm you with a smile and cut you like you want me to

Em              C       G                     D       Em
Cut that little child inside of me and such a part of you

Oh oh the years burn

C                         Em     D   
    I used to be a little boy so old in my shoes

C                           Em              D   
    And what I choose is my choice what's a boy supposed to do

C                                     Em     D   
    The killer in me is the killer in you my love

C                             Em    D   Em    D   C    
    I send this smile over to you




   Em             C                             D      
Disarm you with a smile and leave you like they left me here

   Em          C        G                       D      
To wither in denial the bitterness of one who's left alone

Em     C            G     D       
    Oh oh the years burn

Em     C            G     D    C    
    Oh oh the years burn burn burn

C                           Em             D               C    
    And what I choose is my voice what's a boy supposed to do

C                                     Em     D   
    The killer in me is the killer in you my love
