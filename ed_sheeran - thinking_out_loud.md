C        C/E                           F        G
When your legs don't work like they used to before
C       C/E                         F    G
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C      C/E                           F           G
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
C     C/E                            F      G
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks


            C   C/E           F   G          C  C/E    F G
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70
            C  C/E                  F  G        C    C/E 
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23 
F                         G
And I'm thinking bout how 


Dm                         G      C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                       G
Maybe just the touch of hand
     Dm                          G          Am
Well me I fall in love with you every single day 
    Dm                      G
And I just wanna tell you I am

            C       C/E
So honey now..

F G                          C    C/E
   Take me into your loving arms 
F G                            C        C/E
  Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
F            G                  C     C/E
  Place your head on my beating heart 
             F    G
I'm thinking out loud

          Am  G    F    C/E     Dm   G   C
And maybe we found love right where we are




C            C/E                        F       G
And when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
C      C/E                      F     G
And the crowds don't remember my name
         C      C/E               F          G
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
C         C/E                       F     G
I know you will still love me the same


           C      C/E               F     G            C  C/E        F   G
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           C     C/E            F  G            C     C/E  
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
F                G
And i'm thinking bout how 


Dm                        G       C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                         G
And maybe it's all part of plan
       Dm                      G     Am
Well I'll continue making the same mistake 
Dm                    G
Hoping that you'll understand
C              C/E
That baby now..


F G                        C  C/E    
Take me into your loving arms 
F G                            C        C/E     
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
F G                            C   C/E    
Place your head on my beating heart 
             F    G
I'm thinking out loud


          Am  G    F    C/E     Dm   G   C

             F    G
I'm thinking out loud



           Am  G    F      C/E  Dm   G   C
That maybe we found love right where we are
     Am  G    F      C/E   Dm   G   C
