# Ozzy Osbourne - Mama Iâ€™m Coming Home

```
E
Times have changed and times are strange
E                                   A
Here I come, but I ain't the same
                 E
Mama, I'm coming home
E
Times gone by, seems to be
    E                                      A
You could have been a better friend to me
                 E
Mama, I'm coming home

    C#m                A
You took me in and you drove me out
          E
Yeah, you had me hypnotized
C#m                A
Lost and found and turned around
       B
By the fire in your eyes

    E
You made me cry, you told me lies
E                                 A
But, I can't stand to say goodbye
                 E
Mama, I'm coming home
  E
I could be right, I could be wrong
   E                                A
It hurts so bad, it's been so long
                 E
Mama, I'm coming home

C#m                       A
Selfish love, yeah, we're both alone
    E
The ride before the fall, yeah.
    C#m                 A
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
       B
I just got to have it all.

A                             E
I've seen your face a hundred times,
A                    E
Everyday we've been apart
A       B              E         A
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
       A     B                C D E
'cause mama, mama, I'm coming home
           C D B
