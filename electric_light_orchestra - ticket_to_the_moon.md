# Electric Light Orchestra - Ticket To The Moon

```


Dm
	Remember the good old 1980's,

C
	When things were so uncomplicated,

Bb
	I wish I could go back there again,

A
	And everything could be the same.


           Dm
I've got a ticket to the moon,

G                     	 Dm
    I'll be leaving here any day soon,

G                    Dm            C            Bb
    Yeah, I've got a ticket to the moon,

        C              F           A
But I'd rather see the sunrise, in your eyes.

      Dm		        G
Got a ticket to the moon,

                    Dm			        G
I'll be rising high above the earth so soon,

                          Dm            C            Bb        
And the tears I cry might turn into the rain,

            C               F
That gently falls upon your window,

       A
You'll never know.



Dm       C         Bb   A
Ticket to the moon

Dm       C         Bb   A
Ticket to the moon

Dm            C      Bb   A
Ticket to the moon


Dm                  8 beats each
C  
Dm
C

Bb
Fly, fly through a troubled sky

   C                                  Dm  
Up to a new world shining bright.



Dm		     G
Flying high above,

                          Dm 			G
Soaring madly through the mysteries that come,

                       Dm               C	      Bb
Wondering sadly if the ways that led me here,

           C                  F  
Could turn around and I would see you there,

A
standing there



Dm		      G
Ticket to the moon,

                             Dm		     G
Flight leaves here today from satellite 2,

	             Dm                C     Bb
As the minutes go by what shall I do,

           C                  F
I paid the fare but what more can I say,

      A
It's just one way.



Dm       C         Bb   A
Ticket to the moon

Dm       C         Bb   A
Ticket to the moon

Dm            C      Bb   A
Ticket to the moon
