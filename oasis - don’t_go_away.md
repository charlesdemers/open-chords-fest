Verse 1:
Am7                             Gsus4
Cold and frosty morning there's not  a lot to say
          Fadd9               D7sus4  Fadd9
About the things caught in my mind
    Am7                       Gsus4
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
             Fadd9               D7sus4  Fadd9
With all the things caught in my mind


Bridge:
D7sus4                                 Fadd9
      And I wanna be there when you're      coming down
D7sus4                              Fadd9
      And I wanna be there when you hit  the ground


Chorus:
   Gsus4     C                 C/B
So don't go away, say what you say

Say that you'll stay
              Gsus4                  Fadd9
Forever and a day  in the time of my life
                Gsus4               
Cos I need more time
                Am7          Gsus4       Fadd9   
Yes I need more time just to make things right


Verse 2:
Am7                       Gsus4
Damn my situation and the games I have to play
             Fadd9               D7sus4  Fadd9
With all the things caught in my mind
Am7                       Gsus4
Damn my education I can't find the words to say
             Fadd9               D7sus4  Fadd9
With all the things caught in my mind
