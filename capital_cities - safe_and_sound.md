F	           C
I could lift you up 
	Am
I could show you what you want to see 
     G
and take you where you want to be 

F		    C
You could be my luck 
      Am
Even if the sky is falling down 
   G
I know that we'll be safe and sound 

F		     C
I could fill your cup 
	    Am
You know my river won't evaporate
      G
This world we still appreciate 

F		    C
You could be my luck 
	  Am
Even in a hurricane of frowns 
   G
I know that we'll be safe and sound 

F		     C
I could show you love 
     Am
In a tidal wave of mystery 
        G
You'll still be standing next to me 

F		    C
You could be my luck 
	Am
Even if we're six feet underground 
   G
I know that we'll be safe and sound

I could show you love
In a tidal wave of mystery
You'll still be standing next to me

You could be my luck
Even if we're six feet underground
I know that we'll be safe and sound

We're safe and sound

Safe and sound
Safe and sound
Hold your ground
Safe and sound

I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound

I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound

We're safe and sound
We're safe and sound
We're safe and sound
We're safe and sound

Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Hold your ground
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
